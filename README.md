# Snake Game

Play a never-ending cat and mouse game. Except, you play the role of a snake instead of a cat.

# About 

Move the snake using the arrow keys. Each time you catch a mouse, a new mouse will generate and appear anywhere in your window screen at random.

There is no end to this game. You can catch as many mice as you want.

For better experience, I recommend playing the game in a smaller window screen.

This project is based on the Udemy Course I am currently enrolled, "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course", section 15, (https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/) which I completed to practise my Javascript skill.In particular, the topic on DOM events and the addeventlistener method.
